# Simulating interference effects

This is a program that generates the interference pattern produced by pinholes arranged at the vertices of a regular n-polygon.
If you enter 2 as input, you'll get the standard double slit experiment interference pattern.
For input 3, you'll get the interference pattern formed by 3 small holes that form an equilateral triangle, for 4 you'll get the pattern formed by 4 holes that make a square, and so on.
